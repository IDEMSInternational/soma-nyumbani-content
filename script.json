    "Description": "\n<p><span>In this session, learners are asked to count how many squares they can find in a given square grid. It is\n        expected that learners will see this as a simple task of counting up the squares. Usually, learners tend to only\n        count the unit squares before realising there are many more. When they start counting, they will likely find it\n        hard to keep track of which squares they&rsquo;ve already counted and which they haven&rsquo;t. In this puzzle,\n        we are much more interested in the methodological approach to the counting than in the correct solution. It is\n        then expected that they are encouraged to break down the large square into smaller units and record the\n        respective counts systematically in order to find a method to count the number of squares in any square\n        grid.</span></p>\n",

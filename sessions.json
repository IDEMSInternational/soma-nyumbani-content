It is expected that learners will see this as a simple task of counting up the squares. Usually, learners tend to only count the unit squares before realising there are many more. When they start counting, they will likely find it hard to keep track of which squares they&rsquo;ve already counted and which they haven&rsquo;t. In this puzzle, we are much more interested in the methodological approach to the counting than in the correct solution. It is then expected that they are encouraged to break down the large square into smaller units and record the respective counts systematically in order to find a method to count the number of squares in any square grid.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Develop students&#39; problem solving skills.</span></li><li ><span >Recognise patterns and apply them in different contexts.</span></li><li ><span >Be able to justify solutions to problems accurately.</span></li><li ><span >Learn how to record data and work systematically and in an organised manner.</span></li><li ><span >Gain confidence in sharing ideas openly.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session students will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Considered a challenging problem by studying smaller similar problems.</span></li><li ><span >Tried to find a pattern that would help solve a challenging problem.</span></li><li ><span >Come up with hypotheses and test them.</span></li><li ><span >Applied methods developed to more complex situations.</span></li><li ><span >Produced evidence of their thinking process and working towards a general solution.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Mathematics and financial literacy</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Math brain teasers</span></li><li ><span >Riddles </span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Organizational skills</span></li><li ><span >Communication</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Starter</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To engage students with a mathematical puzzle that is challenging to solve and allow them to identify the need to develop a strategy to solve it.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Students discuss potential approaches and strategies for solving the problem.</span></li><li ><span >Students propose answers or estimate what they think the correct answer is.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Pose the problem and provide a short time for students to try it out. </span></li><li ><span >Encourage students to share answers. </span></li><li ><span >Allow students to suggest answers at any stage they want and give positive feedback, without stating if they are correct or not (&ldquo;Have you considered all possibilities?

The basis around it is making a fun &lsquo;move&rsquo; (see below) for others to &lsquo;mirror&rsquo; (see below). It is meant to not be particularly physically demanding but help learners and teachers be active, while at the same time engender a positive, fun attitude towards community based learning.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Engage in a physical activity to remain active and healthy.</span></li><li ><span >Develop a sense of belonging within their learning group and team working skills.</span></li><li ><span >Establish a good teacher-learner relationship.</span></li><li ><span >Promote creativity.</span></li><li ><span >Combine physical activity and memory exercises.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end the session students will &nbsp;have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Carried out a physical activity.</span></li><li ><span >Developed or improved relationships with each other and with the teacher.</span></li><li ><span >Gained confidence in themselves by reducing self-awareness.</span></li><li ><span >Created a fun and engaging routine to perform, potentially including cultural aspects.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Games and fitness</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Dancing</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Making decisions</span></li><li ><span >Self-esteem</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Creative arts</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Music and dance</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Warmup</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To set out the general idea of the session and engage with students in a friendly manner to establish a good relationship.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Students will get the general idea quickly and have fun copying the teacher, breaking barriers and starting to feel comfortable working together as a group.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >The students and the teacher stand in a circle a good distance away from each other respecting social distancing. The teacher makes a physical &lsquo;move&rsquo; and the students have to mirror it (make the same move). A move could for example be a distinctive pose, a jump, a step forwards and then backwards, a clap on top of your head or anything simple enough to do quickly and go back to standing position. The teacher then carries on with other possible moves, presenting 3 or 4 different moves. Then the teacher makes 2 moves, one after the other, and the students replicate. Teachers could then have combinations of 3 or even 4 moves.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><ol start=\"1\"><li ><span >&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stand in a circle keeping a good distance between each other.&rdquo; </span></li><li ><span >&ldquo;Watch carefully what I do as you will have to do the same thing after.&rdquo; (make first move) &ldquo;Can you do it now?&rdquo; (encourage to have fun while doing so, comments like &ldquo;Go on, you can do better!

The objective is for each member of the team to make moves for the rest of the team to mirror. Emphasise that moves can be creative and varied. Each member takes a turn to create a move and the rest mirror it. After a while there could be short sequences of moves for the rest of the team to mirror. 1 or 2 minutes before the end of the activity the team comes up with one move they find particularly good. Go back into a circle and each member presents the chosen move for everyone to mirror.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><ol start=\"1\"><li ><span >Get into groups of 3 or 4.</span></li><li ><span >Each member of the team creates a move for the rest of the team to mirror.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat so that everyone creates 3 moves, all different to each other.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat with 2 moves in a row, from the moves created by the team.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat with 3 moves in a row, from the moves created by the team.</span></li><li ><span >Select the best move from your team.</span></li><li ><span >Get back into a circle.</span></li><li ><span >Go round the circle with each individual making the &lsquo;best move&rsquo; from their team for everyone to mirror.</span></li></ol><h1 ><span >Activity: Memorising moves</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To exercise memories and have fun in a competition.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >This fun activity will lead to several people losing. Emphasise that it is all good fun.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teacher Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >In order, a member of the circle makes a move and the next person mirrors it and adds a second move. The next person mirrors the two moves in the same order and adds a third one. The next person mirrors the three moves and adds a fourth one. Keep going until someone can&rsquo;t remember the correct sequence.</span></p><p ><span >After a few times around the circle you could add complexity by allowing each member to select who should mirror by shouting their name.

While famous mathematician Paul Erdos stated that &ldquo;mathematics is not ready for this kind of problems&rdquo;, it is simple enough for a young child to understand and play with. In short, you start with a positive integer. If it is even you divide it by 2 and if it&rsquo;s odd you multiply it by 3 and add 1. You then repeat this for the result you get, and keep repeating for subsequent results. The problem suggests that regardless of what number you start with you will eventually get to number 1. For example, starting 7 it would go as follows:</span></p><p ><span >7 -&gt; 3x7+1=22 -&gt; 22/2=11 -&gt; 3x11+1=34 -&gt; 34/2=17 -&gt; 3x17+1=52 -&gt; 52/2=26 -&gt; 26/2=13 -&gt; 3x13+1=40 -&gt; 40/2=20 -&gt; 20/2=10-&gt; 10/2=5 -&gt; 3x5+1=16 -&gt; 16/2=8 -&gt; 8/2=4 -&gt; 4/2=2 -&gt; 2/2=1.</span></p><p ><span >While an incredibly large number of starting numbers were tested so far, there is no certainty that we will always get to the number 1. This session presents this problem in a fun and engaging way, bringing in competition and collaboration.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Be able to carry out mathematical processes accurately.</span></li><li ><span >To carry out simple calculations repeatedly.</span></li><li ><span >To reach conclusions based on evidence.</span></li><li ><span >To understand the importance of justification and be aware that there are problems that are yet to be solved.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session students will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Worked with number patterns.</span></li><li ><span >Recognised links between solutions to problems.</span></li><li ><span >Organised data to present a solution graphically.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Mathematics and Financial Literacy</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Math brain teasers</span></li><li ><span >The Number System</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Environment</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Careers in Science</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life Skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Self-esteem</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Understanding the Problem</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To understand how the sequence works and be able to apply it to small numbers.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners should be able to apply the process to small numbers to test that they always get to the number 1. They should also understand that when they get to 1, the cycle 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1&hellip; keeps repeating forever and we can consider the process finished when we get to 1.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Explain the problem by asking a learner to select a number between 5 and 10. Ask another learner to divide it by 2 if it&rsquo;s even or multiply it by 3 and add 1 if it&rsquo;s odd. Ask the same question with the result to another learner. Keep going until you get to 1, and keep going through the cycle to demonstrate that once you get to 1 you will simply keep repeating the same three numbers.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat the process in the same way with another starting number between 5 and 10 until you get to 1 and let learners decide that you can now stop.</span></li><li ><span >Pose the question of whether it will always get to 1. Allow learners to try it out with a couple of numbers between 10 and 20 and after a while ask individuals what number they started with and whether they got to 1..</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Suggested time: 10-15 minutes.</span></li><li ><span >This activity is ideal to engage all students even if it is one at a time, with simple tasks that they should be able to achieve and build confidence.</span></li><li ><span >If you have access to a board or a flipchart it would be great to depict sequences with a starting number and an arrow going to the next one, as in the following picture demonstrating the case starting with 3 (with arrows going down when you divide by 2 and across when you multiply by 3 and add 1). This will be helpful later on in the session, so doing it from the start might be useful.</span></li></ul><p ><span ><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eNi2Gp8YRkKK08gwE60MHohkjz2YDrNMSMCX0Jl--1ZSzq-oB9P61fA5VLciWyEeiW6aPdsa7EzNDz0gmqY2dKDIlBfqqUJzOH-pcKFyeWRFQuj35Muh11JaBmmGwpZDdJg1HbdI\" title=\"\"></span></p><h2 ><span >Activity </span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Pick a number from 5 to 10. If it&rsquo;s even, divide it by 2, if it&rsquo;s odd multiply it by 3 and add 1. If the result is an even number, divide it by 2 again. If it&rsquo;s odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Keep repeating the process until you can predict what will happen.</span></li><li ><span >Conclude that you can stop when you get to 1.</span></li><li ><span >Pick another number from 5 to 10 and repeat the process. Do you also get to 1?</span></li><li ><span >Now repeat the process for a few more numbers from 10 to 20. Do you also get to 1?</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Competition: The Longest Sequence</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To apply the process accurately and confidently. </span></li><li ><span >To realise that larger numbers don&rsquo;t always lead to longer sequences.</span></li><li ><span >To reinforce that the conjecture holds for &lsquo;small&rsquo; numbers.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will apply the sequence to more numbers in order to find longer sequences. Learners will feel comfortable in their understanding of how the sequence works and become more convinced that they will always get to 1.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Explain the meaning of the length of the sequence: the number of terms you have to go through in order to get to 1, including the starting number and 1 itself. (for example, the length of the sequence starting with 3, i.e. 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, has length 8, and the length of the sequence starting with 7, i.e. 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, has length 17). </span></li><li ><span >Introduce the competition. Individually, learners will work with numbers up to 64 for a given period of time, trying to find the longest sequence they can. </span></li><li ><span >To find the winner, students suggest the length of the longest sequence they could find and the number it started from. Other students verify that the length is correct and if it&rsquo;s not the next longest sequence can be considered for the winner.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Recommended time: 15-20 minutes.</span></li><li ><span >Make it clear how much time learners will have to find the longest sequence and that when the time is up they have to stop and they cannot keep counting how many terms they have.</span></li><li ><span >Remind students when they have 3 minutes left and when they have 1 minute left.</span></li><li ><span >Encourage students to be organised, using the suggested diagrams with arrows presented in the previous activity. You can ask if the arrow diagrams would be of any help (and it can be, for once you get to a number in a diagram you already wrote the rest of the diagram will follow in exactly the same way). Don&rsquo;t make this fact explicit, it would be best if learners discover this, and it is the focus of the next activity.</span></li><li ><span >To engage more students and add a bit of fun and suspense, you can start with the potential third place, then the second and then the first (in each case confirming the position depending on the correct calculations in the sequence).</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Activity</span></h2><p ><span >The length of a sequence is the number of terms it has. If we finish sequences when we reach the number 1, then the number of terms would represent the length of the sequence. For example, starting with 7 we get the sequence 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, which has length 17 as it has 17 terms.</span></p><p ><span >We will have a competition to see who can get the longest sequence with numbers up to and including 64. The winner is the person who can get the longest sequence of the group.</span></p><h1 ><span >Drawing Sequences on Trees</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To recognise that all numbers from 1 to 20, 30, 40 or any larger number (time dependent) lead to 1.</span></li><li ><span >To conclude that it is likely that all numbers lead to 1.</span></li><li ><span >To be able to represent solutions in an organised manner and link solutions for different numbers.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will draw trees to outline their solutions.</span></li><li ><span >Learners should be able to recognise how the solution for one number can help get the solution for another number.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teacher Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Explain the method for representing answers graphically with a diagram in which you go down when you divide by 2 and you go to the right when you multiply by 3 and add 1.</span></li><li ><span >Starting from 1, check what numbers are in the diagram until you find a number that is not.</span></li><li ><span >Work out the sequence for the first missing number until you get to a number that is already in the diagram and add it.</span></li><li ><span >Find the next number that is not in the diagram and work out the sequence until you reach a number that is in the diagram and add it to the tree (this might start to get complicated but try to fit it in, perhaps going to the left instead of going to the right as before).</span></li><li ><span >Repeat a few more times for the next missing numbers.</span></li><li ><span >Let students keep going.</span></li><li ><span >Conclude that you get a tree shaped diagram where you can draw it in such a way that branches do not cross each other.</span></li><li ><span >Pose the question of whether this can help to find long sequences.</span></li></ul><p ><span >Below is a picture of a tree constructed by starting with number 7, and then adding the missing numbers 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 (with their corresponding sequences) until their sequences link with the existing tree diagram.</span></p><p ><span ><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YRRdEybnXnnVAEB8lkNaCBGrUVtJAgTeSC-U-0lbRmRURZxvi9MzghbqTgTVcK-CknqlBYGy6UbgUTPMA7-UG0fybLYaJvtRfQKmAL0V9Hfkv0lTFEFr0gqRLXAQK3kqcq7EDTFg\" title=\"\"></span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Suggested time: 15-20 minutes.</span></li><li ><span >Recommend learners to leave space above and to the sides of their initial diagram.</span></li><li ><span >Recommend that learners work on a separate piece of paper for each number and then plan how to link them so that branches don&rsquo;t cross each other.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Activity</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >You can represent your sequences graphically where you start with your initial number, go down if you divide by 2 and to the right if you multiply by 3 and add 1, ending your diagram when you reach 1.</span></li><li ><span >Start counting from 1 until you find the first number that doesn&rsquo;t appear in your diagram. Work out the sequence for that number and link it to your initial diagram.</span></li><li ><span >Keep counting until you find a second number, work out the sequence and add it to the diagram.</span></li><li ><span >Continue counting and adding new sequences for missing numbers. Try to avoid crossing by writing smaller or going to the left or diagonally rather than to the right and down if needed to avoid crossing.</span></li><li ><span >Does this help you find a long sequence? Can you draw a tree shape around your diagram with branches that don&rsquo;t cross each other?</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Conclusions and Context</span></h2><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To raise awareness that there are unsolved problems and that mathematicians work on identifying new problems and solutions.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners should feel confident that they have explored an unsolved mathematical problem and gain confidence as mathematics students.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions/Activity</span></h2><p ><span >Explain that this problem is an unsolved problem and that in order to have certainty that all numbers will eventually lead to 1 we need an actual proof for it. Mention that many mathematicians have been trying to come up with this proof but have not yet succeeded. Explain that identifying problems, finding solutions to those problems, and finding possible applications of those solutions to other problems is a big part of the job of mathematicians. </span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Suggested time: any time remaining, but try to keep at least 5 minutes for this.</span></li><li ><span >You can mention that there are other open problems, called the millennium problems, which even have a prize of USD 1,000,000 for the person who solves one.</span></li><li ><span >You can encourage students to keep drawing a tree and see how big they can make it including, for example, all numbers up to 50!</span></li><li ><span >Try to get the students to see how the diagram suggests that all numbers lead to 1.</span></li></ul><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662597071000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3WeizjJ-0_7AgL1xdCD-Gn\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

It will initially help learners identify these tasks, figure out the level of priority each task has and how to come up with a plan to manage their daily and weekly routines.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Identify their education, family, and personal responsibilities.</span></li><li ><span >Reflect on the priority of the different responsibilities.</span></li><li ><span >Understand the importance of rest and relaxation.</span></li><li ><span >Recognise the need and means to be healthy in the challenging context we are facing.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session student will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Identified and prioritised their daily tasks and activities.</span></li><li ><span >Drafted a weekly plan to keep up with all their responsibilities and include healthy relaxation activities.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Home Sciences</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Care of the home and compound</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Self-awareness</span></li><li ><span >Time management</span></li><li ><span >Decision making</span></li><li ><span >Goal setting</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Citizenship</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Values Formation</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Identifying and Categorising Responsibilities</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To be able to identify their daily and weekly responsibilities and be able to categorise them in a number of ways.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Students will make a list of their responsibilities and categorise them into daily, weekly or similar categories and into priority categories.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Lead a brainstorming session to get a comprehensive list of all the different potential responsibilities learners can have. </span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Accept any kind of suggestion, emphasising that they might not apply to all of them but all answers are valid as different learners will have different family and social contexts. </span></li><li ><span >Encourage learners to open up and propose possible responsibilities related to their education, their home life and their community life.</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >After having a comprehensive list ask learners to:</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Think about how regular these responsibilities are. Are they daily? A few times per week? Weekly? </span></li><li ><span >Propose a different categorisation in terms of priority. Are they essential? Are they desired? Are they optional? </span></li><li ><span >Allow learners to reflect on these questions and discuss what responsibilities are relevant to them and how they fit into these categories. They could discuss these with a partner they feel comfortable with or do it individually.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Activity </span></h2><p ><span >With the challenges we are all facing with the COVID-19 pandemic, we all have responsibilities that we have to take care of on a regular basis. These can include responsibilities at home, in your local community, family responsibilities, educational responsibilities and any other kind. Make a list of all the possible responsibilities you might have.</span></p><p ><span >Once you finish your list, you should determine how often these responsibilities take place. Are they daily tasks? Do they happen every few days? Are they weekly commitments?</span></p><p ><span >You can also think about the level of priority of your responsibilities. Are they essential, desired or optional? Feel free to create other categories that you might think are relevant.</span></p><h1 ><span >Identifying and Categorising Leisure Activities</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To be able to identify activities that provide pleasure and relaxation.</span></li><li ><span >To distinguish between healthy and not so healthy activities.</span></li><li ><span >To prioritise leisure activities.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Students will make a list of potential leisure activities, distinguish between healthy and not so healthy, and prioritise them.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Carry out a similar brainstorming session about leisurely activities, and add the categorisation into healthy and not so healthy activities. </span></li><li ><span >Emphasise that while keeping up with responsibilities, it is also important to carry out leisure activities</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Activity</span></h2><p ><span >While keeping up with our responsibilities we should recognise that leisure activities are also important. Write down a list of activities that you like doing to relax, have fun and enjoy yourself. What activities bring you pleasure and help you relax?</span></p><p ><span >When you finish your list, try thinking about the possible outcomes of these activities, are they healthy or not so healthy? Can you still carry them out in this challenging time while still maintaining social distance and hygiene? </span></p><p ><span >You should also write down how often you would like to do these things and how important they are for you.</span></p><h1 ><span >Finding a Balance</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To recognise that there is a need to balance between responsibilities and leisure.</span></li><li ><span >To be able to make decisions about how much leisure time would be sensible.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners should identify the importance of their responsibilities and try to find a balance between what they need to do and what they want to do.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teacher Instructions/Activity</span></h2><p ><span >Lead a discussion on what is a good balance between responsibility and leisure. Allow students to voice their views and guide them to reach conclusions. Emphasise that there has to be a balance and that they won&rsquo;t always be able to do all the enjoyable activities they would like to do. Use questions such as (allowing students to respond and not judging their answers):</span></p><ul ><li ><span >How much leisure is sensible without disregarding responsibilities?</span></li><li ><span >How many of the responsibilities are essential?</span></li><li ><span >How many of the leisure activities are essential?</span></li><li ><span >How do you feel about having less leisure time than you would like?</span></li><li ><span >Would you prefer to have longer periods of leisure on a small number of days or shorter periods every day?</span></li></ul><p ><span >NOTE: It is important in this kind of discussion to allow students to provide answers and express themselves freely without providing judgement on the answers. No answer is right or wrong. Rather than qualifying an answer, you could ask learners to try to explain why they feel the way they do or what they think the impact or outcomes of their decisions might be.</span></p><h1 ><span >Preparing a Timetable</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To make decisions on priorities, balancing between responsibilities and leisure activities.</span></li><li ><span >To set achievable targets to fulfill their responsibilities while at the same time including some leisure activities.</span></li><li ><span >To plan a routine that would allow them to keep on top of their responsibilities and include healthy leisure activities.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will write a weekly timetable that includes their responsibilities and leisure activities.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teacher Instructions/Activity</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Draw a timetable for a week that splits the day into 1 or 2 hour slots, from the moment you wake up to the time you go to bed.</span></li><li ><span >Fill in the fixed commitments and essential responsibilities you have in a week.</span></li><li ><span >Fill in the most important leisure activities for you, either for a short time each day or longer times on specific days, making sure that you leave empty spaces for other commitments.</span></li><li ><span >With the remaining slots, use the priorities and level of importance of your list of responsibilities to add to the free slots, taking into account the importance of the responsibilities.</span></li><li ><span >Review the partial timetable and try to add flexible times that could be used for leisure or to carry out important tasks that might come up.</span></li><li ><span >If you are finding that there is not enough time for either your responsibilities or for leisure, think about your responsibilities. If you have too many chores, can you find someone to help you? If you have a lot of spare time, are you prioritising healthy leisure activities? Are you including times for exercising?</span></li><li ><span >In the next couple of weeks try to stick to your timetable, reviewing it if needed. You might want to keep a journal and reflect on how well you&rsquo;ve done to manage and balance what you have to do and what you want to do.</span></li></ul><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662598761000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3LUijV3y6CTO82v7tMIeZo\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

Unfortunately, bullying and violence are common in modern society and are issues learners are likely to have encountered in some shape or form. The objective is to raise awareness of these issues and allow learners to voice concerns, share experiences they might have witnessed or encountered, or provide ideas to tackle such issues. The session will be split into three stages. Firstly, learners will plan the play, identifying one or more key messages they would like to convey and structuring how the story would unfold. Learners will then write the script for the play following their plans. Lastly, they will perform their play and allow their peers to provide constructive feedback for their work.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Reflect on important challenges to daily life that many face and which affect us directly or indirectly.</span></li><li ><span >Be able to draw a plan for a play and understand the importance of planning before writing.</span></li><li ><span >Write a short script for the play. </span></li><li ><span >Play their script in front of the whole group.</span></li><li ><span >Provide constructive criticism to other learners&rsquo; work, also (if available), using technology (video or pictures) to document the play and/or the process to create it.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session students will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Planned a piece of creative writing.</span></li><li ><span >Carried out a piece of creative writing.</span></li><li ><span >Built self-awareness and self-esteem through drama.</span></li><li ><span >Commented on other learners&rsquo; work.</span></li><li ><span >Developed skills in using technology (through the teacher&rsquo;s or their own devices).</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Citizenship</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Values formation</span></li><li ><span >Social responsibility</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Language</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Writing</span></li><li ><span >Public speaking</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Creative arts</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Drama </span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Stop bullying and violence</span></li><li ><span >Communication</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Planning</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To be able to draw a plan for writing a play.

It is a comprehensive but not necessarily complete set of activities so they should not be seen as a complete fitness programme and it is recommended that it&rsquo;s complemented externally in other ways. It aims to present opportunities for learners to carry out similar style exercises on a regular basis so that they can set themselves realistic goals and keep track of progress. Learners will have a warm up activity, followed by 4 fixed stations with defined exercises, and finish with a cool down and stretching activity.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Improve their fitness level through rigorous exercises.</span></li><li ><span >Be aware of the importance of exercising regularly.</span></li><li ><span >Learn how to set realistic goals and self-assess their progress.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session students will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Carried out a comprehensive exercise routine.</span></li><li ><span >Set goals.</span></li><li ><span >Recorded their achievements.</span></li><li ><span >Learned basic exercises that they can carry out in an independent manner as well as within the session.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Games and fitness</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Running games</span></li><li ><span >Athletics</span></li><li ><span >Aerobic</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life Skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Self-esteem</span></li><li ><span >Goal setting</span></li><li ><span >Daily Living Skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Environment</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Physical Exercise and Safety</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Warm Up - The Hopping Game</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To ensure that learners warm up before starting an exercise routine.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have warmed up in preparation for their exercises.</span></li><li ><span >Learners will have enjoyed a fun physical game focusing on self-improvement.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Place learners on a straight line enough distance apart from each other to maintain social distancing. Starting with both feet together next to each other they need to hop as far as they can landing standing up and not taking any extra steps. Comment on how far they reached.

Repeat a few times and let learners try to find a technique that works for them.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat a few times the activity but now learners have to hop twice, trying to achieve the longest possible total distance without falling.</span></li><li ><span >Move on to five hops and after comparing longest distances learners have to sprint back to the initial position.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Suggested time: 5 minutes.</span></li><li ><span >Be encouraging with lengths of hops and try to congratulate all learners with their efforts.</span></li><li ><span >Make sure you emphasise that it&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry, a slightly shorter jump with a safe landing is better than a long jump with a fall!</span></li><li ><span >Don&rsquo;t over-encourage competition to keep the activity safe, focus on self improvement rather than comparing with each other.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Stand on a straight line with sufficient space in front of you, making sure you are far enough from each other while maintaining social distancing. Put both feet together next to each other. You will need to hop forwards as far as you can making sure that you land on your feet without taking any more steps. See how far you managed to get.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat the hop a few times trying to get a technique that works best for you. See if you can improve from each attempt to the next.</span></li><li ><span >After you have a technique that works for you, try adding a second hop from where you land. See how far you can get with two hops. Repeat this a few times trying to improve in each attempt.</span></li><li ><span >Once you reach a distance you think is good enough for you, try taking 5 hops to see how far you can get, and sprint back to your starting point. Take a few seconds to rest and try again.</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: 4 Station Rotation</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To carry out a comprehensive physical exercise routine.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have completed 4 different exercises.</span></p><p ><span >Learners will have kept records of their achievements for progress tracking.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions/Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >There will be 4 different exercise types. Split the group into 4 smaller groups and explain the activity in each station:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Sprints station: Put two markers on the ground, approximately 10 metres apart from each other. Learners will have 10 minutes to sprint from one marker to the other and back continuously, counting how many sprints they manage. They can take it as easy as they need, or even walk if they need to do so, but should not stop within the 10 minutes. Before starting, they should set themselves what they think is an achievable target and reflect on how ambitious they were when they finish.</span></li><li ><span>Situps: Learners will carry out traditional </span><span>situps</span><span>&nbsp;(Lie down with your back on the ground, lift your knees and put your feet flat on the ground. Lift your upper body until you can touch both ankles and then slowly lie back down). Learners will have 5 minutes to do sets of </span><span>situps</span><span >, deciding how many to do at the start of each set, giving themselves targets. They should keep an overall count of the total number of situps and the longest set they managed.</span></li><li ><span >Laps: Set a course for learners to jog around for 10 minutes. It could be anything that is locally available and long enough to allow learners to maintain social distancing. Learners should estimate the number of laps they think they can achieve, keep count, and reflect on how ambitious their assessment was when they finish.</span></li><li ><span >Pushups: Learners will carry out traditional pushups (Lie down with your chest and the tip of your feet on the ground. Place your hands under your shoulders or slightly wider apart. Keeping your back straight, lift your body until your arms are fully stretched, wait one second and lower your body back to the ground). Learners will have 5 minutes to do sets of pushups, deciding how many to do at the start of each set, giving themselves targets. They should keep an overall count of the total number of pushups and the longest set they managed.</span></li></ul><p ><span >Each group will rotate round the four stations, taking 10 minutes on each, using the 5 spare minutes in the situps and pushups sessions to rest.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Suggested time: 10 minutes per station.</span></li><li ><span >Make sure that learners stay a safe distance apart from each other.</span></li><li ><span >Emphasise that learners should take it easy if they need to; it should be challenging but they should not over-exert themselves.</span></li><li ><span >This session will be repeated in similar forms weekly. Encourage students to keep track of their achievements so that they can measure their progress.</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Cool Down and Stretches</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To ensure that learners cool down and stretch at the end of their physical activity.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have safely cooled down and stretched after their exercise session.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions/Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Lead comprehensive stretching routine for 5-10 minutes ensuring you state the importance of stretching and cooling down after exercising. You can use any combination of stretches or you can find plenty of cooldown stretching routines online. Some examples are below.</span></p><ul ><li ><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DIVt1KqKcYZk&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662602472000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NiqtFs9jxCDcg0OaaGRpw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVt1KqKcYZk</a></span></li><li ><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Du5Hr3rNUZ24&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662602473000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VFPBo0Lm5w4TZ3vlvLOns\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Hr3rNUZ24</a></span></li><li ><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DUfmhww_7XNo&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662602473000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sr9NhSgUEcCRN6R28k9b5\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufmhww_7XNo</a></span></li><li ><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dt9NInqDhGv4&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662602473000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3gXBFGEdf4YOAZzYYNCSka\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9NInqDhGv4</a></span></li></ul><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662602474000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2IbnmcNcQiKO5rxFkqRceO\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

It is an engaging session that guides learners through a journey of discovery, providing opportunities for learners to justify mathematical ideas carefully, and allowing them to extend their creativity by creating variations of the game. The game is quite simple: 2 players take it in turn to count from 1 to 21 with the option of counting 1, 2 or 3 numbers. The player who counts the number 21 loses the game. Learners will have an opportunity to try to beat their teacher (the winning strategy is provided below!), play against each other, and challenge each other with games of their own creation.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Be able to think strategically when playing the game and understand the importance of strategy in games.</span></li><li ><span >Gain confidence in their capacity to make conclusions.</span></li><li ><span >Engage with mathematical ideas through games.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session students will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Followed simple rules to play a simple mathematical game.</span></li><li ><span >Found a strategy to win the game.</span></li><li ><span >Understood the justification for the winning strategy.</span></li><li ><span >Created variations of the game and thought about their winning strategies.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Mathematics and Financial literacy</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Math Brain Teasers</span></li><li ><span >Riddles</span></li><li ><span >The Number System</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life Skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Communication</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Teacher vs Student</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To understand how the game works.</span></p><p ><span >To recognise that there has to be a winning strategy.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have observed and played the game enough times to understand the rules.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Explain the game (see below) and demonstrate it with a volunteer learner. Claim to the students that they cannot beat you and ask for volunteers to challenge you to play. Each time you play you should give the learner the option of whether they want to start and it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that they will not provide a winning opportunity as long as you follow the winning strategy (see below). Keep playing against learners until they fully understand the game and make sure you don&rsquo;t give away the winning strategy.</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Rules: 2 players take it in turn to count from 1 to 21 with the option of counting 1, 2 or 3 numbers. The player who counts the number 21 loses the game. For example, player A counts 1, 2, 3, player B counts 4, 5, player A counts 6, 7, player B counts 8, 9, 10, player A counts 11, player B counts 12, 13, 14, player A counts 16, 17, player B counts 18, player A counts 19, 20, and player B is forced to count 21, losing the game.</span></li><li ><span>Winning Strategy: The player who counts the number 21 is the loser, so in order to win, you need to make sure you are the one who counts up to 20. You need to take control of the game by reaching a multiple of 4, as this means that your opponent will be able to count 1, 2 or 3 more, allowing you to get to the next multiple of 4 by counting 3, 2 or 1 more numbers respectively, eventually reaching the number 20. So, if you are green and have secured 4, you can ensure to get to 20 regardless of what your yellow opponent counts: </span><span >1, 2,</span><span >&nbsp;3, 4,</span><span >&nbsp;5,</span><span >&nbsp;6, 7, 8,</span><span >&nbsp;9, 10, 11,</span><span >&nbsp;12,</span><span >&nbsp;13, 14,</span><span >&nbsp;15, 16,</span><span >&nbsp;17,</span><span >&nbsp;18, 19, 20,</span><span >&nbsp;21</span><span>. As such, if your opponent starts the game, since they can count up to 1, 2, or 3, you are always guaranteed to be able to get to 4, and from 4 you are always guaranteed to get to 20 through the multiples of 4. </span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Be flexible with time, it&rsquo;s best to make sure all learners understand the rules of the game and to demonstrate that you can always (or almost if you are not careful) win.</span></li><li ><span >If you don&rsquo;t feel completely comfortable in the mechanics of the game and want to make sure that you win you can play a few times making the opponent start and sticking to the multiples of 4. However, this could give away the winning strategy.</span></li><li ><span >If you let the learner decide who starts and you start you will have to find the first possible opportunity to get to a multiple of 4. For example, the learner could count up to 4 and then up to 8, you can then count to 9 and the learner counts 10 and 11, giving you the opportunity to count to 12, reaching a multiple of 4. If the learner makes you start and is following the winning strategy then it&rsquo;s time to move on to the next activity.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >In this session you will be playing the game 21: 2 players take it in turn to count from 1 to 21 with the option of counting 1, 2 or 3 numbers. The player who counts the number 21 loses the game. For example, player A counts 1, 2, 3, player B counts 4, 5, player A counts 6, 7, player B counts 8, 9, 10, player A counts 11, player B counts 12, 13, 14, player A counts 16, 17, player B counts 18, player A counts 19, 20, and player B is forced to count 21, losing the game. Find someone to play with and see if you can find a way to always beat them.</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Playing the Game</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To be able to play the game accurately and confidently.</span></li><li ><span >To start inferring possible winning strategies.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have played the game enough times to understand the rules.</span></li><li ><span >Learners will have discovered that to win, you need to get to 20, most will have discovered that if you get to 16 you can get to 20, some will have discovered that if you get to 12 you can get to 16 and consequently to 20.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Pair the learners so that they can play against each other. After a few games in the same pair mix the pairs so that they play against other learners. You can mix the pairs again after a short while to encourage further interactions between different groups of learners and help them develop a sense of group.</span></p><p ><span >Initially encourage the learners to simply play the game. After some time, encourage them to think about what they have to do to make sure they win. A few minutes before the end of this activity, encourage them to think about what is better, to start or to let the opponent start.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Once again be flexible with time.</span></li><li ><span >If you find that particular learners are discovering the winning strategy, recognise that you know what they are doing but they should keep their strategy to themselves.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Keep playing the game, against different opponents if possible. While you are playing ask yourself the following questions:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Is there anything you can do to improve your chances of winning?</span></li><li ><span >Is there any way to guarantee that you will win?</span></li><li ><span >IS it better for you to start counting or your opponent to start? </span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Towards a Winning Strategy?</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To discover a winning strategy.</span></li><li ><span >Understand the importance of strategy when playing games.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have reflected on the intricacies of the game.</span></li><li ><span >Learners will have collaboratively found a winning strategy.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Lead a discussion with the learners on what is the winning strategy. Start by asking the question &ldquo;Is it better for you or your opponent to start?&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t give the answer or confirm whether answers suggested are correct. </span></p><p ><span >Ask what number will guarantee a win. All learners will know that if they get to 20 they win. Some might suggest that they need to get to 16. If someone suggests 16 ask them to justify why. If no one suggests 16 ask what number they have to get to so that they are guaranteed to get to 20. Once there is agreement, ask how to guarantee to get to 16 and so on until there is agreement that they need to get to 4.</span></p><p ><span >Once there is agreement that they need to get to 4 in order to win, pose the question about who should start again. Conclude that the game if played strategically the person who starts will always lose.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Be flexible with time so that all learners follow and take part in the discussion.</span></li><li ><span >Play more games against learners to demonstrate each point.</span></li><li ><span >Try to lead the discussion by asking questions rather than by explaining, let the learners reach conclusions.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >In this game there is a method to guarantee that you can always win. Think about what numbers you need to get to in order to win. How can you make sure that you get to those numbers? Why is this the case? Is it better for you to start or your opponent? Why?</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Creating New Games</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To be able to extend the idea by creating variations of the game and defining the winning strategy.</span></li><li ><span >To be able to discover winning strategies for variations of the game.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have created new games, thinking carefully about how each variation leads to a slightly different winning strategy.</span></li><li ><span >Learners will have tried different variations created by their opponents and discovered how to beat them.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Explain that the came can be changed by either trying to get to a larger number in order to lose or by allowing to count more numbers in each turn, or a combination of both. Demonstrate a variation of the game by making the losing number 24 and ask if the strategy changes at all. Demonstrate the game up to 21 but allowing to count up to 4 numbers rather than 3 in each turn and ask if the strategy is once again different.</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Underlying ideas: This game is not about multiples of 4 but about remainders when dividing by 4 (or modular arithmetic mod 4). In the case where you lose if you count 21, your objective is to get to 20, a multiple of 4, which leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 4. </span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >If you extend the game so that the losing number is 24, you win by getting to 23, which leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, so the winning strategy is to ensure you get to all the numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, i.e. 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23. So in this case, in order to guarantee that you get to 3 it is best to start.</span></li><li ><span >If you extend the game to allow players to count up to 4 numbers each time, keeping 21 as the losing number, you still need to get to 20. In order to do so, you will need to get to all the multiples of 5 rather than 4, or in other words the numbers that leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 5.</span></li><li ><span >Combining both variants is a bit more difficult. If you allow players to count up to n numbers in each turn, then you need to divide by n+1. So if the losing number is x, the objective number is x-1. So you want to get to the numbers that leave the same remainder as (x-1) when divided by (n+1). If the remainder is 0 then your opponent should start. Otherwise you should start.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Encourage students to always justify their strategy.</span></li><li ><span >If the learners are getting winning strategies quickly then you may want to lead a discussion about how this relates to remainders.</span></li><li ><span >You may want to split this into 3 different activities, where you consider the first variation only, then the second variation only, and only if the learners are making good progress and you feel confident with the combination of both you propose combining them.</span></li></ul><p ><span ></span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >There are two ways to change this game that leads to interesting differing winning strategies:</span></p><ol start=\"1\"><li ><span >Play the game where the losing number is 24 rather than 21. How does the game change? Choose a larger number as the losing number, how does it change in that case?</span></li><li ><span >Play the game with 21 as the losing number but instead in each turn players can count 1, 2, 3 or 4 numbers. How does the game change in that case? How about if you are allowed to count even more numbers?</span></li><li ><span >How about if you lose the game by counting the number 34 and in each turn a player can count 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 numbers. Is there a winning strategy in this case?</span></li></ol><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662605244000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oMDUtpSV6TaJkujLmW8Xg\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

To be able to identify one&rsquo;s own personal core values.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Students should have understood the concept of personal values, and be able to contribute to a general list of values. They should also have made a list of three personal values which they consider to be at the centre of their values system.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >The learners are provided with a very short definition of values (Values are principles or standards of behaviour that reflect what is important in one&rsquo;s life). They are then asked to reflect on the definition and write in a few lines their own understanding of the definition, and possibly expand it. Some are asked to share their writing with the rest of the group.</span></p><p ><span >Each learner is then asked to provide one or more examples of values. At the end of this brainstorming the group will have come up with a list of values. This can be expanded on if any particularly important values were missed.</span></p><p ><span >Learners are then asked to choose three values that they consider their most important core values, and order them by importance: the first in the list will therefore be the value that they consider the most important. Each of them is then asked to share their list with the whole group.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><p ><span >Below is a (not complete) list of possible values. These are some of the values that the learners might mention. If learners are struggling with the definition or identification of values you could provide some examples. </span></p><p ><span >List of values: Dependability, Reliability, Loyalty, Commitment, Open-mindedness, Consistency, Honesty, Efficiency, Innovation, Creativity, Good humor, Compassion, Spirit of adventure, Motivation, Positivity, Optimism, Passion, Respect, Fitness, Courage, Education, Perseverance, Patriotism, Service to others, Fairness, Spirituality, Success, Integrity, Environmentalism.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Each of you has one or more personal values. Today you will identify your personal values and debate about their relative importance. Before you start, consider the following definition of values:</span></li></ul><p ><span >Values are principles or standards of behaviour that reflect what is important in one&rsquo;s life.</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Write a in a few lines an explanation of how you understand the definition, and expand on it to make it as clear as possible. Share your explanation with the rest of the group.</span></li><li ><span >Write down a list of all the possible values you can think of.</span></li><li ><span >Choose three values from your list that you believe are the most important in your life, and order them by importance. Share your list with your colleagues. To get a sense of what your core values are, ask yourself what activities bring you the most joy, or what you couldn&#39;t live without. What gives your life meaning or what do you want to achieve? If you can articulate those answers, you will likely see a pattern that you can boil down into a single concept, such as a consistently positive attitude. </span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Initial Debate</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To be able to debate about personal values.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners should have organised their ideas, brainstorming and taking notes to come up with arguments to defend their choice of values. They should also have prepared and structured a short speech.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Learners are divided into small groups (4 to 5 members) and asked to debate around the relative importance of their chosen values. Each group should come up with three values that represent the group.</span></p><p ><span >Learners discuss within their groups the relative importance of the values they have chosen. For instance, learners should discuss whether patriotism is more or less important for the group than, for example, respect. In your discussion learners should consider:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Take quick notes using key words rather than full sentences. Think about why the values you have chosen are high up in the list of values of your group, or why they are considered the most important values in your life, and the life of the other members of your group.</span></li><li ><span >Write down as many arguments you can think of to support each of the values you have chosen; then choose a few of the strongest or more convincing arguments. </span></li><li ><span >Prepare a short speech. This is usually structured in five parts:</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Introduction. Express your message and why it&#39;s important to your audience, as well as yourself.</span></li><li ><span >Statement of fact. Break down the general thesis of your argument into smaller parts. This is where you name reasons why the current issue exists.</span></li><li ><span >Confirmation, or proof. Craft your main argument here, as well as reasons why your argument is a successful one.</span></li><li ><span >Refutation. Acknowledge your opposition, giving some credence to their argument, before challenging their point-of-view.</span></li><li ><span >Conclusion. Wrap up your main points of your argument and give instructions on what you want your audience to do or think.</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Deliver your speech:</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Speak slowly and enunciate</span></li><li ><span >Make eye contact</span></li><li ><span >Differentiate the tone of your voice and interest your audience.</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Learners will then vote for the values to become the group&rsquo;s values. Each member will score the values that have been discussed, from 0 to 10, and the total score will be computed per each value. The three values with the highest score will be elected group&rsquo;s values. Each group will then be asked to share their chosen values with all the others. </span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Social Responsibility</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To understand the concept of social responsibility. To reflect on how one&rsquo;s own personal core values relate to the idea of social responsibility.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners should have understood the concept of social responsibility, and reflected on how their personal values relate to this concept.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Learners are given a definition of social responsibility (Social responsibility is an ethical theory in which individuals are accountable for fulfilling their civic duty, and the actions of an individual must benefit the whole of society). They are then asked to reflect on it and write in a few lines their own understanding of the definition. They are then asked to reflect on the extent to which their chosen personal values relate to social responsibility. </span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Let us now introduce the concept of social responsibility. Here is a definition: </span></li></ul><p ><span >Social responsibility is an ethical theory in which individuals are accountable for fulfilling their civic duty, and the actions of an individual must benefit the whole of society.</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Write a few lines to explain your understanding of social responsibility. Afterwards share your interpretation of the definition with the rest of the group.</span></li><li ><span >Look back at your personal list of three values. Ask yourself: Do my values relate to social responsibility? How? How many do and how many do not? To get a sense of how your core values relate to the idea of social responsibility, ask yourself whether the thing that gives your life meaning or that you want to achieve also benefits the wider society. After you have reflected on this, would you change your list or would you leave it as it is? </span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Reviewing Values</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To be able to debate about personal values and how these reflect the idea of social responsibility.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners should have further reorganised their ideas, and some even their personal choice of values. In light of the new concept of social responsibility they should have come up with new/stronger arguments to defend their choice of values. In this second debate they should have more confidence in giving a speech.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Learners will work within the same small groups as earlier, to reassess the relative importance of their chosen values in the light of the concept of social responsibility. </span></p><h2 ><span >Activity </span></h2><ul ><li ><span >In the same group as before and discuss again with your colleagues the values you have chosen to represent your group, taking into consideration the definition of social responsibility. </span></li><li ><span >At the end of the discussion, you will have finalised your group&rsquo;s list of three values. Share your chosen values with the others, particularly explaining whether the list has changed or remained the same, and why. </span></li></ul><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662607663000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3gx0OSeBLHILfcX4nHoKIh\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

If such a place is not available, a room or a field can be set up with any kind of markers (stones, boxes, bottlecaps, or anything locally available) outlining a grid, using markers as vertices of each point. Initially three basic instructions can be given, step forward, turn right or turn left. One learner will act as a robot and the groups will have to give hir or her instructions on how to get from one square in the grid to another square. The activity will then be extended by adding obstacles and further instructions. Learners will be able to create new instructions to get the robot to do a variety of things such as a dance.</span></p><p ><span >The objective of this session is to implicitly introduce ideas related to coding and programming by defining a set of instructions that need to be listed and carried out in order to fulfil a particular objective. The concept of strict unbreakable rules and following instructions regardless of what they are, key ideas in programming, will be highlighted throughout.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >To understand the importance of rigour and clarity in instructions.</span></li><li ><span >To be able to follow step-by-step instructions without deviating.</span></li><li ><span >To develop spatial awareness.</span></li><li ><span >To expand their problem solving and problem posing skills.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session learners will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Written sequences of instructions to solve problems.</span></li><li ><span >Created complexities in problems.</span></li><li ><span >Posed new problems to one another.</span></li><li ><span >Created a robot dance routine to be performed by following clearly defined instructions.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Mathematics and Financial literacy</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Math Brain Teasers</span></li><li ><span >Geometry shapes</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Communication</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Creative Arts</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Music and dance</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Introducing the Human Robot Game</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To be aware of the importance of clearly defined rules and instructions.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have attempted to generate a list of instructions for an individual to act as a robot and get from point A to point B.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span>Set out the grid as presented in the description. Find a volunteer to become the robot and place him or her in a square in the grid facing a particular direction. It is important to explain that whether they want it or not they will have to follow the instructions given by their peers. Present the initial three instructions to the group: turn right (while staying in the same square in the grid), turn left (while staying in the same square in the grid) or move forwards to the square in front of them. Select a different square somewhere else in the grid. The learners (except the robot) get in groups of 3 or 4 and list a sequence of instructions for the robot to follow to get from where they are to the selected square. Each group then takes it in turn to read out the instructions for the robot to follow and test whether it gets to the right place or not. After each go, the robot goes back to the initial square facing the same direction as before.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Even if a group realises that they made a mistake they should read out their full set of instructions anyway and test where the robot would end up.</span></li><li ><span >Groups should not be allowed to change their sequence of instructions after seeing another group&rsquo;s instructions, once they are written down they should remain fixed.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Imagine you have a grid with a very simple robot on it. You can give the robot three instructions: Turn Right (staying in the same square), Turn Left (staying in the same square) or Move Forwards (to the square directly in front of it). The picture below shows an arrow representing the robot and the direction it&rsquo;s facing. Write a sequence of instructions so that the robot gets from where it is to the highlighted square. Once you wrote your instructions, make the robot follow them, without changing anything in your sequence, to test if it gets to the right place. </span></p><p ><span ><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GmCTq-3oBWXdF1hC6HDO-6pfGD70fH8mGMwG4hic_GRkqOr-IU9jk-QWERq6N7c-YkMb-DicK--R1uWxJwryW7RiSDBx6OD7ZGbJEoW-ATToHGDdI1n36SwUPaUGpn8A1OVpfPx3\" title=\"\"></span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Adding Complexities</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To build on their understanding of the abstract sequences instructions by adding complexities.

Learners will start by exploring the idea of a map and a colouring. They will then explore when two maps are the same and how different colourings can be achieved with the minimal number of colours. Finally they will be posed the challenge of finding a counterexample for the theorem, i.e. creating a map that requires 5 or more colours, in order to conclude that all maps can be coloured using 4 colours.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Explore an accessible but complex mathematical concept.</span></li><li ><span >Develop abstraction skills and strategic thinking.</span></li><li ><span >Make inferences and test them. </span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session learners will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Understood the concepts involved in the 4 colour theorem.</span></li><li ><span >Developed strategies to colour maps using the minimum number of colours possible.</span></li><li ><span >Created maps for themselves and their peers to explore.</span></li><li ><span >Worked with complex maps.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Mathematics and Financial literacy</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Geometry shapes</span></li><li ><span >Math Brain Teasers</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Creative Arts</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Draw and paint pictures</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Study and organisational skills</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Understanding Map Colourings</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To understand the main idea about colouring maps.</span></p><p ><span >To be able to colour a map accurately using few colours.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have created some maps and coloured them with as few colours as possible.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Learners should draw a fictional map with at least 15 regions in it.

It presents learners with examples of limericks for them to analyse and identify the basic limerick structure. It then provides opportunities for testing their understanding of this structure by writing and sharing some limericks. It concludes by presenting a challenge where limericks that relate to prompts have to be written by groups of learners and providing an opportunity for the class to write a whole poem written as a sequence of limericks.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Develop poetry writing skills.</span></li><li ><span >Understand the structure of limericks.</span></li><li ><span >Be able to write limericks and assess whether presented poems are limericks.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session learners will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Analysed example limericks to understand the structure of a limerick.</span></li><li ><span >Written and shared their own limericks.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Language</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Poetry</span></li><li ><span >Oral Literature</span></li><li ><span >Writing</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life Skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Communication</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: The Limerick</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To gain familiarity with the concept of poetry styles</span></li><li ><span >To understand the structure of a limerick</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have understood the basic structure of a limerick.</span></li><li ><span >Learners will have understood the idea that a limerick is meant to tell a short funny story in a concise way.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Give Learners some examples of limericks (see Student Instructions) and ask them to identify any similarities between them.

For some people it could be a tree in their garden, a specific place in their home or local community, a place they visited only once, or even a place they read or heard about. Identify one specific such place and think about what positive feelings it triggers and why. What is special about this place? What kind of feelings does it bring to you?</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Making Notes and a Plan</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To be able to write about their feelings.</span></p><p ><span >To develop planning strategies for writing a song or a poem.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have written some notes about the place they identified, what feelings this place brings to them and the reasons why that might be.</span></p><p ><span >Learners will have started planning how they would transform these notes into a poem or song.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Learners should now put their thinking in writing by making notes about what they presented to the group. These could include what the place is, where it is, what it is like, how they would describe it, what sort of feelings it triggers and why they think that&rsquo;s the case. They should write three paragraphs or less.</span></p><p ><span >Learners should then start thinking about how they can turn their notes into a plan for a poem or a song. They should consider what they are going to mention first, will it be a description of the place or their feelings, how they can describe why this place brings these feelings and when in the song or poem they will mention each point. Mention that it is important to write this plan to facilitate the actual production so that everything they will want to mention is included.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >After sharing with the group and having heard their peers&rsquo; ideas, learners might want to change their mind and focus on another place. Encourage learners to do so if they want to.</span></li><li ><span >If you think learners will struggle to get a poem or song, you could allow them to simply write a description or short story instead.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Now that you identified a place that prompts positive feelings to you, you should make notes about this place, where it is, what it is like, how you would describe it, what sort of feelings it triggers, and why you think you feel that way in that place or when you think about that place. </span></p><p ><span >Once you have your notes, draw a plan on how you could transform your notes into a song or a poem about it. What are you going to mention first? Will you start by describing the place or your feelings? How can you describe why this place brings you these feelings? When are you going to mention each of these points in your song or poem?</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Writing the Song</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To write a song about their chosen place.</span></p><p ><span >To be able to carry out a piece of writing from a structured plan.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have written a song or poem about their chosen place.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Learners should follow their plan, perhaps adjusting it slightly as they go along, and write a song or poem. It could be a song based on the tune of a song they already know or it could be completely new.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><p ><span >Encourage learners to write a song and only try a poem or other type of writing if they really would find the song writing overly difficult.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Follow your plan to write a song or poem about your chosen place. If you are writing a song, it could follow the tune of a song you know or it could be a new song altogether. Make sure you follow the plan but feel free to adjust it as you go along if you need to.</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Performing the Song</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To gain confidence to sing their song or recite their poem in front of their peers.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Some or all learners will have performed their piece for the rest of the group.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Volunteer learners should perform their work to the rest of the group. If time allows it would be good for everyone to do so.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><p ><span >Encourage all learners to perform and share their work. However, if they feel strongly about it you can allow them to not share it but encourage them to find someone to share it with afterwards as it is a good mechanism to identify and share their feelings.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Once you finish writing your song or poem, sing it or recite it to a friend or family member.</span></p><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662622831000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Vm6XPtxfBQuIZqeoqQEKR\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

Make sure you draw everything in this activity lightly as is it simply a guide which you may choose to erase later on. </span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Using a pencil (if available) draw a point as close as possible to the centre of a blank page. </span></p><p ><span >Draw four circles of different sizes with this point as the centre (concentric circles). If you have a pair of compasses you can use them. If you don&rsquo;t, you can use a ruler to draw several (6 to 10) points all at the same distance from the centre, spread out around the centre and use them as a guide to draw your circles freehand.</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >The circles could all be the same distance apart from each other (e.g. with radius 1.5 cm, 3 cm, 4.5 cm and 6 cm respectively) or you can mix the distances from circle to circle to get a less regular result (e.g. with radius of 2 cm, 3 cm, 5.5 cm and 6.5 cm respectively)</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Divide the circles into 8 equal pieces with straight lines going through the centre. The easiest way to do this reasonably accurately if you don&rsquo;t have a protractor is to draw a first horizontal line, splitting the circles in half. Then draw a vertical line (perpendicular to the horizontal one) to split the circles into 4 pieces. Then try to draw two diagonals splitting each quarter of the circles in half, making your 8 pieces.</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >You now have the basic structure around which you can draw your mandala.</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Drawing the Mandala</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To develop spatial awareness.</span></p><p ><span >To understand how the basic structure can be used to construct regular patterns of shapes.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have drawn their mandalas.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >The basic structure already constructed is formed of one internal circle and three &lsquo;rings&rsquo; (the space between two consecutive circles). </span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Starting from the inner ring, choose a simple shape such as an oval, a triangle, a star, an arrow, or anything else you can imagine. You will have to draw it in a regular pattern inside the ring. Think about how many times you would like to draw your shape in the ring and how many should fit in each eighth of the ring (divided by the straight lines). Draw a point in the position where you will draw each shape as a guide. </span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Once you have located the position of each shape, you can draw them with pencil first to make sure you can erase and correct them if you make a mistake. Try to keep the shapes simple so that you can keep them as similar to each other as possible and make sure that you have a regular pattern, with the same number of shapes in each eighth of the ring. The shapes could be at the centre of the ring, closer to the top or closer to the bottom but you should try to be consistent in the positioning within the ring. When you are satisfied with your shapes, you can draw them over with a pen.</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Repeat this process for the other rings. If you feel confident you could try to combine two shapes in the same ring, one at the top and one at the bottom, or even try drawing more complicated shapes. You could also have shapes that overlap with each other. The best mandalas have a variety of shapes and each shape appears a different number of times.</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Once you completed the rings, move on to the circle.You have two options. You can choose another simple shape, and draw it several times with its centre at the centre of the circle, rotated and overlapping with each other. Alternatively, you can draw a simple shape in the same way as before on the outer part of the circle and keep the middle blank.</span></p><p ><span >Once you have completed your mandala, you can decide whether you want the initial circles or not. If you want to keep them, draw them over with a pen. Making sure that the ink from the pen is fully dry, erase the initial construction lines you drew earlier on.</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Colouring the Mandala</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To learn how to colour mandalas as an introspective or relaxation exercise.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have coloured the mandalas in silence while thinking about themselves and being aware of how they feel while doing so.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Colour your mandala with as many colours as you&rsquo;d like. While you do so, remain in silence and try to think about how you feel at that point in time, concentrate on your breathing and reflect on what you can do to feel better and help others feel better at the same time.</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >To colour the mandala, select a region or shape you will want of a given colour and use it to colour all the same regions or shapes regularly. You may want to alternate colours within a ring. If you don&rsquo;t have colours available you can do it in one single colour, leaving regions without colour, and filling other regions with small dots or lines. </span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Sharing the Experience</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To be able to reflect on their feelings and voice them within their group.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Lerners will have discussed how it felt to colour their mandala and whether it had an effect on their mood, whether good or bad, and why.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Lead a reflection with the learners asking them whether the silent colouring of their mandala made an impact on their mood. Do they feel any different now? If so, how? Why do they think this might be?</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >No answer is an incorrect answer. It is extremely important to allow learners to voice how the experience felt without passing judgement.</span></li><li ><span >After a learner shares their experience, other learners could suggest whether they felt similar things or their experience was completely different. </span></li></ul><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662624350000&amp;usg=AOvVaw30Utp_B3yYor37UrOaIeMw\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

The first chest is labelled Gold Coins. The second chest is labelled Silver Coins. The third chest is labelled Gold Coins and Silver Coins. You are given the possibility of, without watching, take one coin from one chest of your choice and use it to place the correct label in each chest.

You can then place the Gold Coins and Silver Coins on the first chest.</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Similarly, if you found a gold coin in the third chest, you can remove the Gold Coins label from the first chest and place it on the third chest. You now know that the second chest is incorrectly labelled Silver Coins so you need to place the Silver Coins label in the only available chest, which is the first chest. You can then place the Gold Coins and Silver Coins on the second chest.</span></p><p ><span >In this way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the coin taken from the third chest is gold or silver as you have a process to correctly label the chests in both situations.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >It may very well be the case that the puzzle takes up the whole hour.

Which chest should you open?</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Answer (do not share!):</span><span >&nbsp;If the label in the first chest is true then it is full of scorpions and the second chest contains the gold. According to the second label, one of the labels is true and the other one is false, which means that the second label would have to be false, so either both labels are false or both are true. You are assuming that the first label is true so both would have to be true, but then the second label would have to be true and false at the same time, which is not possible. Therefore, the first label has to be false, which means that the second label is true, satisfying the second label.

The first one has an inscription that says &ldquo;the gold Is here&rdquo;. The second one has an inscription that says &ldquo;the gold Is not here&rdquo;. The third one has an inscription that says &ldquo;the gold is not in the second chest&rdquo;. However, you are also told that at least one of the inscriptions is true and at least one is false. Which chest would you open?</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Answer (do not share!): </span><span >In this puzzle we have to analyse all the possible combinations of true or false inscriptions in the different chests. We can automatically discard the possibility of all being true and all being false, leaving 6 possible options:</span></p><ol start=\"1\"><li ><span >The first and second are true and the third is false.

However, this cannot happen as if the first is true then the gold has to be in the first chest and if the second is false then the gold has to be in the second chest, which &nbsp;is not possible.</span></li><li ><span >The first is true and the second and third are false. However, this cannot happen as if the first is true then the gold has to be in the first chest, if the second is false the gold has to be in the second chest, and if the third is false then the gold has to be in the second chest, which is not possible.</span></li><li ><span >The first and second are false and the third is true. However, this cannot happen as if the second is false the gold has to be in the second chest but it the third is true then the gold cannot be in the second chest, which is not possible,</span></li><li ><span >The first and third are false and the second is true. However, this cannot happen as if the second is true then the gold cannot be in the second chest and if the third is false then the gold has to be in the second chest, which is not possible.</span></li><li ><span >The last option left is that the first is false and the second and third are true, which means since the first is false, the gold cannot be in the first chest, and as the second and third being false both indicate that the gold has to be in the second chest. As such, this is the only option that is not problematic and the gold is in the second chest.</span></li></ol><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662625641000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fY_yK5sDiI1HT1AA5g31v\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

The first team then designs a race by selecting the type of sprints and stationary exercise for the first member to compete in. A winner is selected, giving the team a point. The second team then designs another race and it takes place by the second runner. The next team then creates a third race and the third competition takes place.</span></p><p ><span >Teams then select a new order (or the same if they prefer) and the next team designs the next race. </span></p><p ><span >Repeat until all learners have taken part in at least 3 races (9-12 repetitions at least).</span></p><p ><span >By the end, the team with the most points is the winner.</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Cool Down and Stretches</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To ensure that learners cool down and stretch at the end of their physical activity.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have safely cooled down and stretched after their exercise session.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions/Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Lead comprehensive stretching routine for 5-10 minutes ensuring you state the importance of stretching and cooling down after exercising.

This is a problem that has engaged mathematicians throughout the history of modern mathematics at least. It presents learners with three activities on this theme, focusing on justification of results, and proposes three questions for further investigation. A key aspect of the session is determining whether justifications are correct and complete. Solutions for the more complicated activities are presented in the description of the activity for reference.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Develop abstraction skills.</span></li><li ><span >Explore simple mathematical concepts that can lead to sophisticated conclusions.</span></li><li ><span >Work imaginatively with numbers.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session learners will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Explored a numerical problem in detail.</span></li><li ><span >Justified arguments accurately.</span></li><li ><span >Decided when a justification is complete.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Mathematics and Financial literacy</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Math Brain Teasers</span></li><li ><span >The Number System</span></li><li ><span >Expressions and Equations</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Study and organisational skills</span></li><li ><span >Making decisions</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Starter Challenge</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To gain familiarity with the concept of the problem for this session.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have found as many integers as possible that can be written as the sum of consecutive numbers in 5 minutes.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span>Pose the challenge of finding as many integers (whole numbers) between 1 and 20 that can be written as a sum of positive consecutive numbers, for example, 5 can be written as 2+3, giving them 5 minutes to do so. After the 5 minutes, go through numbers from 1 to 20 asking if any learner managed that number and how. For each number ask if it can be done in any different way (several numbers can be written as a sum of consecutive numbers in different ways, for example 15 = 7+8 = 4+5+6 = 1+2+3+4+5).</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >It is likely that most learners will only try to write numbers as the sum of only two consecutive numbers. If you notice that this is the case for most learners you can give them the hint that more than two consecutive numbers can be used.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Some integers (whole numbers) can be written as a sum of consecutive positive integers. For example, 5 = 2+3. How many numbers between 1 and 20 can you write as the sum of consecutive integers in 5 minutes?</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Multiples of 3</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To be able to make conclusions and justify them.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have understood why all multiples of 3 can be written as the sum of three consecutive positive integers.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Learners should focus on multiples of 3. Can all multiples of 3 can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers? If so, why? Present the question to learners, give them time to think about it individually, then discuss it with one or two peers and then share with the whole group. The group should come up with a final answer with a clear explanation.</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><p ><span >Answer (do not share!):</span><span>&nbsp;All multiples of 3 can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. In the case of 3 it can be done as 1+2. For all other multiples of 3 you can simply divide it by 3 and consider the successor and predecessor, for example if you consider 12 and divide it by 3 you get 4, which has a predecessor of 3 and a successor of 5, and 3+4+5=12. Algebraically, a multiple of 3 can be written as </span><img src=\"https://www.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chf=bg,s,FFFFFF00&amp;chco=000000&amp;chl=3n\"><span>. Dividing it by 3 you get </span><img src=\"https://www.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chf=bg,s,FFFFFF00&amp;chco=000000&amp;chl=n\"><span>, which has a predecessor of </span><img src=\"https://www.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chf=bg,s,FFFFFF00&amp;chco=000000&amp;chl=n-1\"><span>&nbsp;and a successor of </span><img src=\"https://www.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chf=bg,s,FFFFFF00&amp;chco=000000&amp;chl=n%2B1\"><span>.

It is a comprehensive but not necessarily complete set of activities, so they should not be seen as a complete fitness programme and it is recommended that they are complemented externally in other ways. This session aims to present opportunities for learners to carry out similarly styled exercises on a regular basis so that they can set themselves realistic goals and keep track of progress. Learners will have a warm up activity, followed by 4 fixed stations with defined exercises, and finish with a cool down and stretching activity.</span></p><p ><span >NOTE: This is the same fitness routine presented in Day 3. The objective is to repeat the same fitness routine once a week and allow learners to keep track of their progress and assess their achievements. The warm up and cool down could be changed every week if desired.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Improve their fitness level through rigorous exercises.</span></li><li ><span >Be aware of the importance of exercising regularly.</span></li><li ><span >Learn how to set realistic goals and self-assess their progress.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session students will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Carried out a comprehensive exercise routine.</span></li><li ><span >Set goals.</span></li><li ><span >Recorded their achievements.</span></li><li ><span >Learned basic exercises that they can carry out in an independent manner as well as within the session.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Games and fitness</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Running games</span></li><li ><span >Athletics</span></li><li ><span >Aerobic</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life Skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Self-esteem</span></li><li ><span >Goal setting</span></li><li ><span >Daily Living Skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Environment</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Physical Exercise and Safety</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Warm Up - The Hopping Game</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To ensure that learners warm up before starting an exercise routine.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have warmed up in preparation for their exercises.</span></li><li ><span >Learners will have enjoyed a fun physical game focusing on self-improvement.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Place learners on a straight line far enough apart from each other to maintain social distancing. Starting with both feet together they need to hop as far as they can landing standing up and not taking any extra steps. Comment on how far they reached. Give a hint on how they achieve more distance: &ldquo;crouch down bending your knees and swing your arms to try to help gain more distance&rdquo;. Repeat a few times and let learners try to find a technique that works for them.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat the activity a few times but now learners have to hop twice, trying to achieve the longest possible total distance without falling.</span></li><li ><span >Move on to five hops and after comparing longest distances learners have to sprint back to the initial position.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Suggested time: 5 minutes.</span></li><li ><span >Be encouraging with lengths of hops and try to congratulate all learners with their efforts.</span></li><li ><span >Make sure you emphasise that it&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry, a slightly shorter jump with a safe landing is better than a long jump with a fall!</span></li><li ><span >Don&rsquo;t over-encourage competition to keep the activity safe, focus on self improvement rather than comparing with each other.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Stand on a straight line with sufficient space in front of you, making sure you are far enough from each other while maintaining social distancing. Put both feet together next to each other. You will need to hop forwards as far as you can making sure that you land on your feet without taking any more steps. See how far you managed to get.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat the hop a few times trying to get a technique that works best for you. See if you can improve from each attempt to the next.</span></li><li ><span >After you have a technique that works for you, try adding a second hop from where you land. See how far you can get with two hops. Repeat this a few times trying to improve in each attempt.</span></li><li ><span >Once you reach a distance you think is good enough for you, try taking 5 hops to see how far you can get, and sprint back to your starting point. Take a few seconds to rest and try again.</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: 4 Station Rotation</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To carry out a comprehensive physical exercise routine.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have completed 4 different exercises.</span></p><p ><span >Learners will have kept records of their achievements for progress tracking.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions/Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >There will be 4 different exercise types. Split the group into 4 smaller groups and explain the activity in each station:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Sprints station: Put two markers on the ground, approximately 10 metres apart from each other. Learners will have 10 minutes to sprint from one marker to the other and back continuously, counting how many sprints they manage. They can take it as easy as they need, or even walk if they need to do so, but should not stop within the 10 minutes. Before starting, they should set themselves what they think is an achievable target and reflect on how ambitious they were when they finish.</span></li><li ><span>Situps: Learners will carry out traditional </span><span>situps</span><span>&nbsp;(Lie down with your back on the ground, lift your knees and put your feet flat on the ground. Lift your upper body until you can touch both ankles and then slowly lie back down). Learners will have 5 minutes to do sets of </span><span>situps</span><span >, deciding how many to do at the start of each set, giving themselves targets. They should keep an overall count of the total number of situps and the longest set they managed.</span></li><li ><span >Laps: Set a course for learners to jog around for 10 minutes. It could be anything that is locally available and long enough to allow learners to maintain social distancing. Learners should estimate the number of laps they think they can achieve, keep count, and reflect on how ambitious their assessment was when they finish.</span></li><li ><span >Pushups: Learners will carry out traditional pushups (Lie down with your chest and the tip of your feet on the ground. Place your hands under your shoulders or slightly wider apart. Keeping your back straight, lift your body until your arms are fully stretched, wait one second and lower your body back to the ground). Learners will have 5 minutes to do sets of pushups, deciding how many to do at the start of each set, giving themselves targets. They should keep an overall count of the total number of pushups and the longest set they managed.</span></li></ul><p ><span >Each group will rotate round the four stations, taking 10 minutes on each, using the 5 spare minutes in the situps and pushups sessions to rest.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Suggested time: 10 minutes per station.</span></li><li ><span >Make sure that learners stay a safe distance apart from each other.</span></li><li ><span >Emphasise that learners should take it easy if they need to; it should be challenging but they should not over-exert themselves.</span></li><li ><span >This session will be repeated in similar forms weekly. Encourage students to keep track of their achievements so that they can measure their progress.</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Cool Down and Stretches</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To ensure that learners cool down and stretch at the end of their physical activity.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have safely cooled down and stretched after their exercise session.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions/Student Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >Lead comprehensive stretching routine for 5-10 minutes ensuring you state the importance of stretching and cooling down after exercising. You can use any combination of stretches or you can find plenty of cooldown stretching routines online.

If we add the diagonals we get top-right + bottom-left = x+(x+8) = 2x+8, and top-left + bottom-right = (x+1)+(x+7) = 2x+8 and so both diagonal sums are always the same.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >This will work for any design of month (different number of days or start day for the month.

It should be a simple action, nothing too complicated, and it should be possible to perform it individually while maintaining social distancing. While a member of the team performs the action, the rest should observe it carefully and note down a detailed step-by-step list of movements that are required to carry out their action.</span></p><p ><span>Each team then performs their action (multiple times if needed) and shares their list of movements required to carry out their actions.

The session starts with a warmup language memory game, later, building on with a similar writing exercise. Learners will have to decide on a topic and plan for their story through a group discussion in which they will have to reach group decisions. They will write the start of the story collaboratively and have an opportunity to complete it independently.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Develop team working skills.</span></li><li ><span >Make decisions and compromises collaboratively.</span></li><li ><span >Improve language and writing skills.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session learners will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Engaged in a language game.</span></li><li ><span >Discussed the topic, plot and plan for a short story.</span></li><li ><span >Decided together on the plan for the story.</span></li><li ><span >Started writing the story collaboratively.</span></li><li ><span >Had an opportunity to complete their story.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Language</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Language games</span></li><li ><span >Writing</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Making decisions</span></li><li ><span >Leadership</span></li><li ><span >Communication</span></li><li ><span >Conflict resolution</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Memory Game</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To have fun with a language game.</span></li><li ><span >To exercise their memory.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Learners will have played a memory language game.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span>Organise the learners so that there is a clear order they will follow in the game. The first learner starts by choosing a word that could be the start of a sentence. The next learner should repeat the first word and add a second word to the sentence. The next one repeats both words and extends the sentence with a third word. Each following learner has to recite the sentence and add a word to it until someone repeats the sentence incorrectly or is unable to add a word. Writing is not allowed and the sentence has to make sense in English. When a learner loses the game, the next learner simply starts again with another sentence.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Discourage competition. This is meant to be a fun warmup for the next activity.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat the game enough times for every learner to have at least 3 attempts.</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Selecting a Topic and Plot</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To propose topics and possible plots for a story.</span></li><li ><span >To collaboratively select a topic and plot for a collaborative story.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have discussed topics and plots for a collaborative writing exercise.</span></li><li ><span >Learners will have found ways to decide on the topic and plot for the story.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Explain the activity to the learners: They will collaboratively write a short story, in which groups will write a sentence or short paragraph each in order to write a collaborative short story. They first need to decide a topic for the story. Learners should discuss with each other and decide what the general story will be about.</span></p><p ><span >Once the learners have agreed on a topic they should start thinking about smaller details. What will the plot be? Where and when will the story take place? How many and what type of characters will the story have (short story should not have many characters)? Will the characters have a specific type of personality? Pose these questions to the learners and as before let them make the decisions and define the plan for the story.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Decision making and conflict resolution is a key objective of this activity. Try to minimally interfere with the discussion and decision making. It would be best to only come into the discussion if it&rsquo;s taking too long to encourage learners to make a decision.</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Starting the Story</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To collaboratively start writing a story. </span></li><li ><span >To be able to follow an agreed plan.</span></li><li ><span >To be adjustable and compromise if decisions are not what they hoped.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have started to write a story as a group activity.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >Split the learners into groups of 3 or 4. One team should write the starting sentence for the story and share it with the group. The rest of the learners should be given the chance to propose small changes but ultimately it is the team&rsquo;s decision on what the starting sentence is. The next team then writes the next sentence or two, or even a short paragraph, and shares it with the group. Once again the rest of the learners should be given a chance to offer small improvements but it is the suggesting team who holds the final decision. Continue until each team makes at least two suggestions.</span></p><h2 ><span >Suggested Guidelines</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Provide some thinking time to each group before they share.</span></li><li ><span >Encourage changes so that the story is correctly written, follows the agreed plan or shows a clear improvement.</span></li><li ><span >Discourage changes for negative reasons.</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Finishing the Story</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >To complete the story started as a group.</span></li><li ><span >To develop creative writing skills.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Learners will have completed the story.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions </span></h2><p ><span >After having an agreed start to the story, learners should complete the story, sticking as much as possible to the agreed plot. There may not be much time for this, encourage learners to complete it independently and share it if they don&rsquo;t complete it within the session or if they would like to write an ending they are proud of.</span></p><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600662638527000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2RmUpwrdx0umzN0JReL3Hc\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

It presents learners with opportunities to compare exponential growth with other types of growth and provides opportunities for reflection of these in the different contexts. It has a stronger focus on the spread of disease and provides a very simplistic model on how mitigating strategies can reduce the rate of contagion of a communicable disease.

What can be done to reduce the spread of a disease? Allow the group to identify methods to reduce the spread of diseases (quarantining, travel restrictions, social distancing, hygiene and hand washing, face masks, etc).

When you clap, they need to quickly select an animal: lizard, starfish or spider. They will then have 30 to 60 seconds to carry out the exercise associated with each animal. The lizard should lie on the ground with the chest down and do push ups. The starfish should carry out star jumps. The spider should lie on the ground on their backs and move their legs and arms back forth as if they were walking on a ceiling. While the learners carry out their exercise, you should count the number of each animal. When you clap again you shout the name of the animal most learners chose and everyone who chose that animal should quickly jog around the circle in a clockwise direction, at least 2 metres away from the circle, keeping good distance between each other. When they get back to their original position, they stop and leave the circle.

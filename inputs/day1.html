It is expected that learners will see this as a simple task of counting up the squares. Usually, learners tend to only count the unit squares before realising there are many more. When they start counting, they will likely find it hard to keep track of which squares they&rsquo;ve already counted and which they haven&rsquo;t. In this puzzle, we are much more interested in the methodological approach to the counting than in the correct solution. It is then expected that they are encouraged to break down the large square into smaller units and record the respective counts systematically in order to find a method to count the number of squares in any square grid.</span></p><h2 ><span >Session Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >The objectives of this session are to:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Develop students&#39; problem solving skills.</span></li><li ><span >Recognise patterns and apply them in different contexts.</span></li><li ><span >Be able to justify solutions to problems accurately.</span></li><li ><span >Learn how to record data and work systematically and in an organised manner.</span></li><li ><span >Gain confidence in sharing ideas openly.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >By the end of the session students will have:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >Considered a challenging problem by studying smaller similar problems.</span></li><li ><span >Tried to find a pattern that would help solve a challenging problem.</span></li><li ><span >Come up with hypotheses and test them.</span></li><li ><span >Applied methods developed to more complex situations.</span></li><li ><span >Produced evidence of their thinking process and working towards a general solution.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Areas involved</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Mathematics and financial literacy</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Math brain teasers</span></li><li ><span >Riddles </span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Life skills</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Organizational skills</span></li><li ><span >Communication</span></li></ul><h1 ><span >Activity: Starter</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To engage students with a mathematical puzzle that is challenging to solve and allow them to identify the need to develop a strategy to solve it.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Students discuss potential approaches and strategies for solving the problem.</span></li><li ><span >Students propose answers or estimate what they think the correct answer is.</span></li></ul><h2 ><span >Teaching Instructions</span></h2><ul ><li ><span >Pose the problem and provide a short time for students to try it out. </span></li><li ><span >Encourage students to share answers. </span></li><li ><span >Allow students to suggest answers at any stage they want and give positive feedback, without stating if they are correct or not (&ldquo;Have you considered all possibilities?

The teacher makes a physical &lsquo;move&rsquo; and the students have to mirror it (make the same move). A move could for example be a distinctive pose, a jump, a step forwards and then backwards, a clap on top of your head or anything simple enough to do quickly and go back to standing position. The teacher then carries on with other possible moves, presenting 3 or 4 different moves. Then the teacher makes 2 moves, one after the other, and the students replicate. Teachers could then have combinations of 3 or even 4 moves.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><ol start=\"1\"><li ><span >&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stand in a circle keeping a good distance between each other.&rdquo; </span></li><li ><span >&ldquo;Watch carefully what I do as you will have to do the same thing after.&rdquo; (make first move) &ldquo;Can you do it now?&rdquo; (encourage to have fun while doing so, comments like &ldquo;Go on, you can do better!

The objective is for each member of the team to make moves for the rest of the team to mirror. Emphasise that moves can be creative and varied. Each member takes a turn to create a move and the rest mirror it. After a while there could be short sequences of moves for the rest of the team to mirror. 1 or 2 minutes before the end of the activity the team comes up with one move they find particularly good. Go back into a circle and each member presents the chosen move for everyone to mirror.</span></p><h2 ><span >Student Instructions</span></h2><ol start=\"1\"><li ><span >Get into groups of 3 or 4.</span></li><li ><span >Each member of the team creates a move for the rest of the team to mirror.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat so that everyone creates 3 moves, all different to each other.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat with 2 moves in a row, from the moves created by the team.</span></li><li ><span >Repeat with 3 moves in a row, from the moves created by the team.</span></li><li ><span >Select the best move from your team.</span></li><li ><span >Get back into a circle.</span></li><li ><span >Go round the circle with each individual making the &lsquo;best move&rsquo; from their team for everyone to mirror.</span></li></ol><h1 ><span >Activity: Memorising moves</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objectives</span></h2><p ><span >To exercise memories and have fun in a competition.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >This fun activity will lead to several people losing. Emphasise that it is all good fun.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teacher Instructions</span></h2><p ><span >In order, a member of the circle makes a move and the next person mirrors it and adds a second move. The next person mirrors the two moves in the same order and adds a third one. The next person mirrors the three moves and adds a fourth one. Keep going until someone can&rsquo;t remember the correct sequence.</span></p><p ><span >After a few times around the circle you could add complexity by allowing each member to select who should mirror by shouting their name. For example Mike makes a move and shouts Priscilla. Priscilla mirrors it, adds her own move and shouts John. John mirrors the two moves, adds a third move and shouts the name of the person to follow.</span></p><h1 ><span >Activity: Creating a routine</span></h1><h2 ><span >Objective</span></h2><p ><span >To be creative and artistic, and work as a team.</span></p><h2 ><span >Expected Outcomes</span></h2><p ><span >Students work in groups to create a routine of moves, adding song and dance if desired and perform it to the rest of the group.</span></p><h2 ><span >Teacher Instructions</span></h2><ol start=\"1\"><li ><span >Split into groups of 4 or 5</span></li><li ><span >Come up with a routine, a sequence of moves that is fun, creative and cool, adding song and dance if you feel like it</span></li><li ><span >Rehearse the routine</span></li><li ><span >Each team perform the routine for the rest</span></li></ol><div><p ><span >This work is licensed by IDEMS International under a </span><span ><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600347823999000&amp;usg=AOvVaw29lZEUd-SE49cQID9Q6n0d\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span >.

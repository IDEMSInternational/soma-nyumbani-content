{"Description": "<p ><span >This physical activity session aims to allow teachers and learners to engage in a joint activity that will serve as an icebreaker and help establish a friendly yet purposeful learning relationship. The basis around it is making a fun &lsquo;move&rsquo; (see below) for others to &lsquo;mirror&rsquo; (see below). It is meant to not be particularly physically demanding but help learners and teachers be active, while at the same time engender a positive, fun attitude towards community based learning.</span></p>", "Warmup": {"Student Instructions": "<ol start=\\\"1\\\"><li ><span >&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stand in a circle keeping a good distance between each other.&rdquo; </span></li><li ><span >&ldquo;Watch carefully what I do as you will have to do the same thing after.&rdquo; (make first move) &ldquo;Can you do it now?&rdquo; (encourage to have fun while doing so, comments like &ldquo;Go on, you can do better!

The teacher then carries on with other possible moves, presenting 3 or 4 different moves. Then the teacher makes 2 moves, one after the other, and the students replicate.

Each member takes a turn to create a move and the rest mirror it. After a while there could be short sequences of moves for the rest of the team to mirror. 1 or 2 minutes before the end of the activity the team comes up with one move they find particularly good.
